//More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons,
// write more tests.Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//Tests for equality and inequality with strings
// Tests using the lower case function
//Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
//Tests using "and" and "or" operators
//Test whether an item is in a array
//st whether an item is not in a array

//DEFINE VERIBLES
