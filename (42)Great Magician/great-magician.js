//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
//Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
// Define the function to show magicians names
function show_magicians(magician) {
    magician.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}
//Function to make magicians great through .map() it will modify array
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (name) { return " The Great ".concat(name); });
}
// Define an arry containing magicians name
var magician_names = ["junaid bangali", "mai pursan", "perkash bangali", "gory wali sarkar"];
//Call make_great function to print each magician name 
var great_magicians = make_great(magician_names);
//Call show_magicians that show modified list if magician
show_magicians(great_magicians);
